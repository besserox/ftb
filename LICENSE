LICENSING:

Short Answer: Everything is GPL and LGPL where appropriate.  See the
directories and individual source files for the specific license.

Rather than carry around all the license headers in each file, FTB
software contains a short comment at the top of the file providing the
license type and version number.  For example:

# License:  LGPL (see license.LGPL for details)

or

# License:  GPL (see license.GPL for details)

Those  license files can  be found  in FTB/misc.   If you  are not
familiar with  LGPL or GPL licensing,  please see the  files above and
also visit www.gnu.org.

Long Answer: As always, this is a tricky issue.  As a general rule, I
like to release software BSD, since it provides the most freedom to
end users and companies.  However, in recent months, it has become
clear that several companies that produce HPC systems are very happy
to take Open Source BSD code from the community, but reluctant to
distribute their modified changes back to the community.  In other
words, they have taken BSD code from the community and handed the HPC
community back proprietary code that cannot be improved, debugged, or
changed.  This behaviour cripples the relationship with HPC scientists
and the vendors.  To remedy this obviously very bad situation, we have
decided to release all code under GPL or LPGL licenses, so we can
partner with those vendors who actually want to collaborate on shared,
Open Source code created by the HPC community.
