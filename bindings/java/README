Java FTB Client Package Release 0.5


Installation
============

1. Java FTB Client Package comes in a single jar file "jftb.jar" that
   can be found under "lib" directory. Modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
   include the path to "jftb.tar", for instance, for bash users,

   % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/hoony/jftb/lib/jftb.jar

   where /home/hoony/jftb is the path to where Java FTB Client Package
   is stored.

2. Define an environment variable FTB_BSTRAP_SERVER to denote the IP
   address of FTB database server host.

   $ export FTB_BSTRAP_SERVER=<IP ADDRESS>

   If FTB_BSTRAP_SERVER variable is not set, Java Client will assume
   the database server will be running on the same machine (localhost).

Building Your Java FTB Client
=============================

1. Java FTB Client is compatible with jdk-1.5 or higher.


2. To use Java FTB Client API, simply import ftb.client package, i.e.,


   import ftb.client.*;

   public class YourJavaClient {
      ...
   }


Documentation 
=============

A tutorial "Tutorial.pdf" and API documentation in HTML are available under "docs" directory.


Examples
========

Three examples are included under "examples."

  - SimpleSubscriber.java demonstrates how to subscribe to an
    event. It particularly shows how to retrieve events using polling.
    This is a Java version of "ftb_simple_subscriber."

  - SimpleCallback.java demonstrates a subscription to an event with callback.

  - SimplePublisher.java demonstrates how to publish events. This is a Java version
    of "ftb_simple_publisher."

  Note: These client codes also work with their C counterparts, i.e.
  SimpleSubscriber with ftb_simple_publisher,  
  SimplePublisher with ftb_simple_subscriber, and
  SimpleCallback with ftb_simple_publisher.
