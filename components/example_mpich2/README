Please note that this directory contains a gentle patch for modifying
mpich2, at a very high level, to show how a component may work with FTB.  

Please refer to the MPICH2 directory, that will be created by the MPICH2
developers under the component hierarchy, for the actual FTB-enabled
MPICH2 code. 

This directory just contains a minor patch and does not reflect a true
FTB-enabled MPICH2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This patch is for mpich2-1.0.5p4, providing a sample code for how a MPI
component report job failure.  Currently it's plugged into MPD, so it
requires python binding.

It requires:
	python >= 2.4 for ctypes
	mpich2-1.0.5p4

To try:
	download mpich2-1.0.5p4
	
	copy the ftb.py from examples/python_binding to src/pm/mpd of
	mpich2
	
	apply the mpd_ftb_patch set LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the path to
	
	libftb_polling.so start ftb server first before running MPI jobs
	using MPICH2
