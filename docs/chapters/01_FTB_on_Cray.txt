There are very minor differences between building FTB for CRAY and LINUX.
The only difference is to use the "--with-platform=cray" option during
configure time.

Please refer to 01_FTB_on_Linux.txt for more information on FTB 0.6.2
under Cray XT series that runs Compute Node Linux (CNL). For more details
or information about the FTB installation at Cray XT4 (Jaguar) at ORNL,
send an inquiry to parkbh@ornl.gov.

Please refer to the 01_FTB_on_Linux.txt file for more instructions.
