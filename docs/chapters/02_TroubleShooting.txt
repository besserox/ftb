6.0 TROUBLE-SHOOTING
=====================
We will keep adding trouble shooting issues in here. You are free to email cifts_discuss@googlegroups.com for any issues.


1) Nothing is happening! ftb_database_server is launched, ftb_agent
	is launched and the examples have been launched! But, nothing
	can be seen on the screen.
	
A)	There might be multiple reasons why things may not be working.
	(a) Check if you specified the IP address of the boot-strap server and not the HOSTNAME

	(b) Did you change the boot-strap port or agent port information?

	(c) Before launching the FTB-enabled software, ensure that
	the ftb_database_server and ftb_agent can communicate. You
	can do this by configuring FTB with --enable-debug and
	seeing the messages that pop on the screen


2) ftb_database_server and ftb_agent cannot communicate?
A)	(a) Multiple ftb_database_server have been launched on the system?
	(b) There can be multiple other reasons incuding some mentioned in (1)


3) On launching the FTB-enabled software example, you get the
	message: "error while loading shared libraries: libftb.so: cannot
		open shared object file: No such file or directory"
A) You need to set the path to the FTB shared library. Use the
	LD_LIBARY_PATH environment variable or modify ld.so.conf
