FTB 0.6.2 TROUBLE-SHOOTING
=====================
We will keep adding trouble shooting issues in here. You are free to email cifts_discuss@googlegroups.com for any issues.


1) Nothing is happening! ftb_database_server is launched, ftb_agent
is launched and the examples have been launched! But, nothing
can be seen on the screen.
	
There might be multiple reasons why things may not be working.
(a) Check if you specified the IP address of the boot-strap server and not the HOSTNAME
(b) Did you change the boot-strap port or agent port information?
(c) Before launching the FTB-enabled software, ensure that
the ftb_database_server and ftb_agent can communicate. You
can do this by configuring FTB with --enable-debug and
seeing the messages that pop on the screen


2) The following warnings are seen when an executing FTB client is killed using "Ctrl ^C"
[FTB_WARNING][ftb_manager_lib.c: line 860]FTBN_Recv_msg failed -20
[FTB_WARNING][ftb_agent.c: line 56]FTBM_Wait failed -20

This happens because some the FTB library did not receive the
expected messages. This would not occur is FTB_Disconnect was called
to exit elegantly.


3) On launching the FTB-enabled software example, you get the
message: "error while loading shared libraries: libftb.so: cannot
open shared object file: No such file or directory"

You need to set the path to the FTB shared library. Use the
LD_LIBARY_PATH environment variable or modify ld.so.conf
