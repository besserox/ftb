Default configuration (Linux) should suffice to build and launch FTB 0.6
under Cray XT series that run Compute Node Linux (CNL). However, depending
on the environment setup, some adjustments may be required during the
installation. For more details or information about the FTB installation at
Cray XT4 (Jaguar) at ORNL, send an inquiry to parkbh@ornl.gov.

Please refer to the 03_FTB_on_Linux.txt file for more instructions.
